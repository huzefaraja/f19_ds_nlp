      "Q. Okay.\n",
      "MR. FIORE: Have those been produced?\n",
      "MR. HUNTER: I think they have. And, Bob, I'm pretty sure they have. But if they haven't, obviously they will be.\n",
      "MR. FIORE: Thank you.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever give any other written accounts of what happened on the evening of December 23rd, 2011 other than to the police officer as part of his investigation?\n",
      "A. Just what I gave to the insurance company, you know, the representatives.\n",
      "Q. Did you give anything in writing to the insurance company, or was it by --orally, was it by phone?\n",
      "MR. HUNTER: Objection. Can I have a continuing to the insurance company?\n",
      "MR. FIORE: Yes.\n",
      "MR. HUNTER: That's fine. Thank you, sir. Go ahead, sir, you can answer.\n",
      "A. I believe I did.\n",
      "Q. That you wrote something out for them?\n",
      "A. I think there was something written out for them.\n",
      "Q. Were you dealing with the adjuster at that time?\n",
      "A. I --I believe what the --to my recollection, the insurance adjuster when the gentleman passed away or shortly thereafter contacted me and informed me that the Law Offices of Blake Hunter & Associates would be the persons that I would be working with, and that all communication at that point would be through the law office and not through the adjuster. That was my recollection.\n",
      "Q. Fair enough. Did you ever provide a written statement to the adjuster about how the accident happened?\n",
      "A. I don't recall, sir. I don't recall providing anything in writing. I gave them a verbal statement over the phone. They asked questions. I gave a verbal statement over the phone. I don't recall being asked to provide a written statement separate from what was already submitted to --that I had already given to the police.\n",

      "A. No, sir. I was not keeping a diary.\n",
      "Q. How about a journal of experiences or making notes of what happened for the day?\n",
      "A. I may have made a couple notes to jog - you know, I kept a copy of what I --I wrote down maybe what happened for myself that --you know, for what happened that day, you know, after I had spoken with the insurance adjuster just to --just to keep my own --to know what I --to keep my memory fresh because –\n",
      "Q. Do you still have that writing?\n",
      "A. I think anything that I --anything that I had was given to Mr. Hunter's law office.\n",
      "Q. Okay. But that writing was created before Mr. Hunter's representation?\n",
      "A. No, sir. Anything was –\n",
      "Q. Is that correct?\n",
      "A. No, sir. Anything that I wrote would have been because I --anything I wrote down was probably after Mr. Hunter's representation because it wasn't anything --I didn't keep a note like\n",
      "day-to-day.\n",
      "Q. All right. But you had said after you talked to the adjuster, you wrote it down for yourself?\n",
      "A. Oh, it might have been some time afterwards. It wouldn't have been right then.\n",
      "Q. Okay. But you did that for yourself?\n",
      "A. Yeah. I may have written something for myself. But I --it wasn't --it wouldn't have been --it wasn't like, you know, an hour later or a day or two days later. It would have been some time later.\n",
      "Q. And you still have that writing?\n",
      "A. Anything that --again, anything that I wrote, anything that I have has already been submitted to --to the law offices.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever have any discussions with anyone who said they witnessed all or part of the accident?\n",
      "A. At the accident scene, a lady came over to me. I had --I was sitting, as I recall, or was standing on the grass on the lawn. I think probably that --and near where the gentleman was injured, not too far away. And a lady came over to me. She identified herself as a nurse. And she asked me if I was all right. She made a comment, it was an accident. It was --I know it wasn't your fault. It just occurred. And I told her I was okay. And it was a very short conversation. She gave me her identifying information. She said she saw --saw something. I don't know what she saw, but she said she saw something. And she gave me her identifying information, which I subsequently supplied to the insurance company. And I tried to supply it to the police officer, but they told me that they already had her information.\n"

I --I believe what the --to my recollection, the insurance adjuster when the gentleman passed away or shortly thereafter contacted me and informed me that the Law Offices of Blake Hunter & Associates would be the persons that I would be working with, and that all communication at that point would be through the law office and not through the adjuster. That was my recollection.\n",
      "Q. Fair enough. Did you ever provide a written statement to the adjuster about how the accident happened?\n",
      "A. I don't recall, sir. I don't recall providing anything in writing. I gave them a verbal statement over the phone. They asked questions. I gave a verbal statement over the phone.

      "Q. Do you still have that writing?\n",
      "A. I think anything that I --anything that I had was given to Mr. Hunter's law office.\n",
      "Q. Okay. But that writing was created before Mr. Hunter's representation?\n",
      "A. No, sir. Anything was –\n",
      "Q. Is that correct?\n",
      "A. No, sir. Anything that I wrote would have been because I --anything I wrote down was probably after Mr. Hunter's representation because it wasn't anything --I didn't keep a note like\n",
      "day-to-day.\n",
      "Q. All right. But you had said after you talked to the adjuster, you wrote it down for yourself?\n",
      "A. Oh, it might have been some time afterwards. It wouldn't have been right then.\n",
      "Q. Okay. But you did that for yourself?\n",
      "A. Yeah. I may have written something for myself. But I --it wasn't --it wouldn't have been --it wasn't like, you know, an hour later or a day or two days later. It would have been some time later.\n",
      "Q. And you still have that writing?\n",
      "A. Anything that --again, anything that I wrote, anything that I have has already been submitted to --to the law offices.\n",
      "Q. Did you ever have any discussions with anyone who said they witnessed all or part of the accident?\n",
      "A. At the accident scene, a lady came over to me. I had --I was sitting, as I recall, or was standing on the grass on the lawn. I think probably that --and near where the gentleman was injured, not too far away. And a lady came over to me. She identified herself as a nurse. And she asked me if I was all right. She made a comment, it was an accident. It was --I know it wasn't your fault. It just occurred. And I told her I was okay. And it was a very short conversation. She gave me her identifying information. She said she saw --saw something. I don't know what she saw, but she said she saw something. And she gave me her identifying information, which I subsequently supplied to the insurance company. And I tried to supply it to the police officer, but they told me that they already had her information.\n"
