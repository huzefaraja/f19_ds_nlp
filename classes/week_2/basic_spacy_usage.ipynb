    "Visible launched last year with little fanfare, offering a stripped down, iPhone-only version of wireless service you could access only through an app. It offers you a decent deal -- as long as you don't mind artificially limited speeds. The service has only one option, a $40 plan (taxes included) that covers unlimited text message, voice, wireless hotspot and data -- that's always limited to 5 megabits a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service has been operating quietly for the last few months as it works to get its infrastructure ready to handle a large volume of customers. (Despite running on Verizon's network, the business built out a more efficient network within Verizon to handle its customers.) But on Thursday, the company said it would begin financing iPhones for customers who wanted a new device. Separately, Visible also said it would support Android smartphones, starting with the Galaxy S9 and S9+.\"\"\""
